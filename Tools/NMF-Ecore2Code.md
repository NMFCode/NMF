# NMF

This package contains the code generator to generate C# (or VB.NET or Python) code from an Ecore or NMeta metamodel. It is meant to be installed as a tool.

## Why should I use this package?

Upon installation, the code generator is available as a command-line tool `Ecore2Code` and should be on the PATH. It can be used for the following scenarios:

- Generate C# code from an Ecore metamodel. This code generation uses an NMeta metamodel as an intermediate step. You can also save the generated NMeta metamodel.
- Generate C# code from an NMeta metamodel.
- Generating code in VB.NET is also supported
- Generating code in Python has limited support, since the target platform is currently not maintained. Raise an issue if you need this feature.

## Where can I get more information?

There is a [documentation website](https://nmfcode.github.io/) which we try to maintain that contains a few tutorials.
There are [publications](https://nmfcode.github.io/publications/index.html) if you want to explore the technical details.
Also, please feel free to [ask a question or report a bug](https://github.com/NMFCode/NMF/issues).
