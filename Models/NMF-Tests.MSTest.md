# NMF Models

The modeling foundation of NMF is a system that represents models as instances of classes generated for their meta-classes. 

## Why should I use this package?

This package contains generic abstract tests suites for model elements written against the MSTest API. It provides the generic class
`ModelTest<T>`. Creating a test class from this generic base class and providing a non-abstract type as parameter, the generic test class automatically covers the code generated from
the NMF code generator.

## Where can I get more information?

There is a [documentation website](https://nmfcode.github.io/) which we try to maintain that contains a few tutorials. 
There are [publications](https://nmfcode.github.io/publications/index.html) if you want to explore the technical details.
Also, please feel free to [ask a question or report a bug](https://github.com/NMFCode/NMF/issues).
