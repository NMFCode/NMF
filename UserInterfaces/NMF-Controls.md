- `TreeEditor` is a clone of the EMF tree editor as a WPF control

## Where can I get more information?

There is a [documentation website](https://nmfcode.github.io/) which we try to maintain that contains a few tutorials. 
There are [publications](https://nmfcode.github.io/publications/index.html) if you want to explore the technical details.
