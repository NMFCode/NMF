# NMF AnyText

This package contains the core AnyText library, an incremental packrat parser with support for left recursive grammars and optimized for the Language Server Protocol (LSP).

## Why should I use this package?

In most cases, it is recommended to use the extended EBNF syntax to specify a grammar for AnyText, so rather use the `NMF-AnyText` package that will
extend this package with tooling.

## Where can I get more information?

There is a [documentation website](https://nmfcode.github.io/) which we try to maintain that contains a few tutorials.
There are [publications](https://nmfcode.github.io/publications/index.html) if you want to explore the technical details.
Also, please feel free to [ask a question or report a bug](https://github.com/NMFCode/NMF/issues).
