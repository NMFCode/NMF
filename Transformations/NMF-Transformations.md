# NMF Transformations

NMF Transformations (NTL) is a model transformation language implemented in an internal DSL.

## Why should I use this package?

This package contains the basic class `ReflectiveTransformation` that is used to create a model transformation using NTL.

## Where can I get more information?

There is a [documentation website](https://nmfcode.github.io/) which we try to maintain that contains a few tutorials. 
There are [publications](https://nmfcode.github.io/publications/index.html) if you want to explore the technical details.
Also, please feel free to [ask a question or report a bug](https://github.com/NMFCode/NMF/issues).
