# NMF Synchronizations

NMF Synchronizations is a language for bidirectional model synchronizations supporting incremental change propagation. 
It is based on the theory of synchronization blocks and provides an internal DSL.

## Why should I use this package?

This package contains the classes for NMF Synchronizations. In particular, the class `ReflectiveSynchronization` that creates synchroinization rules from
the public nested class of the base synchronization class.

## Where can I get more information?

There is a [documentation website](https://nmfcode.github.io/) which we try to maintain that contains a few tutorials. 
There are [publications](https://nmfcode.github.io/publications/index.html) if you want to explore the technical details.
Also, please feel free to [ask a question or report a bug](https://github.com/NMFCode/NMF/issues).
