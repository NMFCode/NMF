# NMF GLSP

NMF GLSP is an implementation of the GLSP protocol by tailoring NMFs synchronization technology to graphical editors using the Graphical Language Server Protocol (GLSP).

## When to use this package?

The core class provided by this package is the class `GraphicalLanguage` that allows you to specify your own graphical DSL in an internal DSL embedded in C#. 
From such a class, NMF GLSP can retrieve a full GLSP implementation.

## Where can I get more information?

There is a [documentation website](https://nmfcode.github.io/) which we try to maintain that contains a few tutorials. 
There are [publications](https://nmfcode.github.io/publications/index.html) if you want to explore the technical details.
