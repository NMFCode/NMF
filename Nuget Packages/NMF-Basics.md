# NMF

This is a meta-package that installs `NMF-Repository` and further adds the tooling required to generate generate code from the PowerShell Console inside Visual Studio.
Installing this package is equivalent to installing both `NMF-Repository` and installing `NMF-Ecore2Code` as a tool.

## Where can I get more information?

There is a [documentation website](https://nmfcode.github.io/) which we try to maintain that contains a few tutorials. 
There are [publications](https://nmfcode.github.io/publications/index.html) if you want to explore the technical details.
Also, please feel free to [ask a question or report a bug](https://github.com/NMFCode/NMF/issues).
