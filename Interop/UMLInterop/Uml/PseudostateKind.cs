For example, a junction can be used to converge multiple incoming transitions into a single outgoing transition representing a shared transition path (this is known as an merge). Conversely, they can be used to split an incoming transition into multiple outgoing transition segments with different guard conditions. This realizes a static conditional branch. (In the latter case, outgoing transitions whose guard conditions evaluate to false are disabled. A predefined guard denoted 'else' may be defined for at most one outgoing transition. This transition is enabled if all the guards labeling the other transitions are false.) Static conditional branches are distinct from dynamic conditional branches that are realized by choice vertices (described below).

It allows splitting of transitions into multiple outgoing paths such that the decision on which path to take may be a function of the results of prior actions performed in the same run-tocompletion step. If more than one of the guards evaluates to true, an arbitrary one is selected. If none of the guards evaluates to true, then the model is considered ill-formed. (To avoid this, it is recommended to define one outgoing transition with the predefined else guard for every choice vertex.) Choice vertices should be distinguished from static branch points that are based on junction points (described above).
